# cpsc3375-database-project
## Project Description
### Background
We learned about relational databases in this class. We started this project by coming up with an idea for a database project. My database is for an online retailer using a dropshipping fulfillment model. I have some experience working for a company like this in the medical equipment industry. We did not have a system that was well suited to this model, so this seemed like a good project for me to explore. The first step was to identify all the entities that would be involved and the attributes of those entities. Next, we took this list and began building the entity relationship diagram. Next, we built the database and added the tables using MySQL workbench. Finally, we added some initial data to the tables. 
### Python / MySQL Integration
For this part of the project, we are using the MySQL connector to connect our datbase to Python. Once this is complete, we are going to make a simple graphical user interface (text based at this time) where a user could interact with the database.
