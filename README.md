# cpsc3375-database-project
## Project Description
### Background
We learned about relational databases in this class. We started this project by coming up with an idea for a database project. My database is for an online retailer using a dropshipping fulfillment model. I have some experience working for a company like this in the medical equipment industry. We did not have a system that was well suited to this model, so this seemed like a good project for me to explore. The first step was to identify all the entities that would be involved and the attributes of those entities. Next, we took this list and began building the entity relationship diagram. Next, we built the database and added the tables using MySQL workbench. Finally, we added some initial data to the tables. 
### Python / MySQL Integration
For this part of the project, we are using the MySQL connector to connect our datbase to Python. Once this is complete, we are going to make a simple graphical user interface (text based at this time) where a user could interact with the database. 

### Project Topic Changed & Version 1.0 Completed
I changed my database for this project from the online retailer one to one for a blog. The online retailer db was just too big for me to deal with for my first project of this sort. I changed to a simple db for a blog that only has two tables - compared to the 15 or so for the previous one. Version 1.0 of this project is a simple command line interface that will allow the user to create an account, sign in, create a post, delete a post, and view all posts. This is a very simple project, but it was a good way for me to get aquainted with mySQL.connector for python.
